# Wave function collapse

An implementation of a [wave function collapse algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse) using JavaScript and a p5.js framework for visualisation. 

A local server is needed to run the application (such as VSCode's Live server). After the server is up and running the application can be started from the `index.html` file.
